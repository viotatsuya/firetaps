FireTaps is basically TapsOfFire with a few tweaks.  I have worked closely with the creator of TapsOfFire during this project.  The main reason I'm doing this is because the developer of TapsOfFire no longer has time for the project and I know a lot of people still really like this application.  I will be actively developing this application and trying to add in whatever people want.  The reason this isn't simply modifying TapsOfFire is that it's not compatible with devices lower than Andriod v.2.0, and the ToF developer wanted it to be separate because of that.  It is also going to have a separate key than ToF so it won't be completely compatible.   -chuesterx

Edit: This is now slightly outdated, I modified FireTaps to work with 1.6- as well.  The branch still exists though.

Differences right now between ToF and FT:

  * FT has multitouch
  * FT doesn't crash on the end of songs on Nexus Ones
  * FT is in the Android market
  * FT has an active developer
  * FT has ads in menus (revenue is split between ToF developer and FT developer)

To download more songs:

  * Search for "Frets on Fire songs" online
  * Download any Frets on Fire compatible song
  * Place the song file in /sdcard/FireTaps/songs (create it if it doesn't exist)
